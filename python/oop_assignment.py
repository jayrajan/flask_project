# For this challenge, create a bank account class that has two attributes:
#
# * owner
# * balance
#
# and two methods:
#
# * deposit
# * withdraw
#
# As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.
#
# Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.




class Account:
    def __init__(self,owner,balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def __repr__(self):
        return (f'Account for {self.owner} with a balance of Â£{self.balance}')      
    
    def deposit(self,deposit):
        self.balance = deposit + self.balance
        print('Deposit Successful')

    def withdraw(self,withdraw):
        if (withdraw > self.balance):
            print('Amount requested is more than the balance')
        else:
            self.balance = self.balance - withdraw
            print('Withdrawal Successful')





# # 1. Instantiate the class
acct1 = Account(owner='Jose',balance=100)


# # 2. Print the object
# print(acct1)
print(acct1)




# # 3. Show the account owner attribute
# acct1.owner
print(acct1.owner)



# # 4. Show the account balance attribute
# acct1.balance
print(acct1.balance)



# # 5. Make a series of deposits and withdrawals
acct1.deposit(50)

# acct1.withdraw(75)
acct1.withdraw(75)



# # 6. Make a withdrawal that exceeds the available balance
acct1.withdraw(200)
print(acct1)


# # ## Good job!
